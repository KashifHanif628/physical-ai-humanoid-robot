# ROS 2 Fundamentals Module Tasks Generation

## Prompt Text
```
$ARGUMENTS
```

## Response Text
Generated comprehensive task list for the ROS 2 fundamentals module following the Spec-Kit Plus methodology. Created 42 specific tasks organized across 7 phases: Setup, Foundational, and 4 user stories (3 P1 priority, 1 P2 priority). Tasks follow the required checklist format with proper IDs, story labels, and file paths. Each user story is organized to be independently implementable and testable. Tasks cover all aspects of the module: installation guide, communication patterns, Python control with rclpy, and URDF fundamentals.

## Outcome
Task list successfully created with 42 specific tasks organized by user story priority. Ready for implementation following the Spec-Kit Plus methodology. Each task follows the required format with proper ID, story label, and file path. Dependencies and parallel execution opportunities clearly identified.
